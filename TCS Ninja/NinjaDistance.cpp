/*
Amarasimha wanted to know the final position of a person, who starts from the origin 0 0 and travels per the following scheme.

-He first turns and travels 10 units of distance
-His second turn is upward for 20 units
-The third turn is to the left for 30 units
-The fourth turn is downward for 40 units
-The fifth turn is to the right(again) for 50 units
â€¦ And thus he travels, every time increasing the travel distance by 10 units.
